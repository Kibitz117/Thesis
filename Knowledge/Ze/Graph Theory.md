## Graph Theory
- Graphs: has a node and connections between nodes(Edges)
- Edges
	- Can be undirected(Both directions)
	- Directions(source to destination)one-way
	- Can be weighted
- Types
	- [[Trees]]
- Graph questions
 - Can I find the shortest path?
	 - [[Searching Algortihms]]
## Programatically
- Node

	- Graph Representation (Adjacency List)
		- Allows us to have a list of nodes instead of many blanks spots like an Adjacency Matrix
