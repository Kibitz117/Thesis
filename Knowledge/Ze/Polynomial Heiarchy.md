- #P
- #NP- class of all problems that can be verified in polynomial time
- #CoNP - 
- PSpace contains many quantifiers including #P,#NP,and #CoNP
- There is a certain heiarchy two Polynomial problems (P C NP C ....)
- THM:
	- TISP(T,S)=all languages solved by TM that runs in time T and uses space S
	- NTIME(n) [non-deterministic] not contained in TISP(n^1.2,n^0.2)
	- We can't prove NTIME cause of space constraint
	- Proof
		- Claim 1: If you thin NTIME(n) contained DTIME(n^1.2)=> Sigma2 TIME(n^8) is contained in NTIME(n^9.6)
		- English If non-determinism not so poweful ,sigma 2 is not so powerful 
		- Claim 2: TISP(N^12,N^2) is contained in sigma2 TIME(n^8)
		- English: (poly hierarchy powerful in simulating TISP algo)
		- Proof for Claim 2: Let L + TISP(n^12,n^2) 
			- Let M be the TM[#TuringMachine]
