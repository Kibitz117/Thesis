- The distribution of a GP is a distribution not a singular number
	- ![See the source image](https://yuki-koyama.github.io/mathtoolbox/gaussian-process-regression/examples.png)
- GPs can be used with a shit ton of inputs
- #Machinelearning

- Efficient hyperparameter selection
- #Kernel function measures the similarity between two inputs
- You can model by adding multiple #Kernel 
- Doesn't scale well in high dimensions
