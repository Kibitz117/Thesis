# [[Action Potential]]

- If [[Neurons]] are depolarized enough to raise the membrane potential above a certain thershold a positive feedback process starts and [[Neurons]] generate [[Action Potential]]
- an AP is a ~100 mV spike in electrical potential across a #cell  membrane 
- It only lasts around 1 ms
- There is a #Refactoryperiod where after an [[Action Potential]] is generated, it is very hard to initiate another one
- They can propegate long distances  without #attenuation (IMPORTANT)
