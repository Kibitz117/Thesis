## Hedging
- Contracts for hedging:
	-  #FuturesContracts
	- [[Options]]
- Long Hedge:hedge that invloves a long position in [[Futures]]
- Short Hedge: a hedge that involves a short in [[Futures]]
- Perfect Hedge: hedge that completely eliminates #risk (would return 0)
- Stack and roll: When a hedge expiration is later than the delivery date of [[Futures]] an investor gets new [[Futures]] or [[Options]] to replace expired positions
- [[Basis Risk]] 
- Optimal Hedge: product of the coeficient of correlation between change in #Spotcontract price and [[Futures]] price and the ratio of sd of both
