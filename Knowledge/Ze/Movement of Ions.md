Speed of Ion movement depends on
1. Strength of electric field (Stronger field, faster)
2. Charge (Bigger charge,faster)

This is an equations for #speed, but it can help us find total #Flux

This is the equation for #Flux for drift
The total #Flux is this equation

Because net #Flux is usually 0, this leads us to the [[Nernst Equation]]
